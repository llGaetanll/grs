# GRS - Gaetan's React Starter

The point of this template is to remain simple. It only uses packages that I absolutely need.

## Included

- `webpack 5`
- `babel 7`
- `emotion 11`

## Running

```
npm run serve
```

Comes with hot reloading.

## Deploying

```
npm run build
```

All outputs will be in the `/dist` directory.
